    Added support for solvers from the diffrax package:
    https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax. A new option 
    is enabled to pass in an object -- a solver from diffrax
    instead of a string for a jax or scipy solver, for example:
    
      from diffrax import Dopri5
      from qiskit-dynamics.solvers.solver_functions import solve_ode

      sol = solve_ode(
          rhs: some_function,
          t_span: some_t_span,
          y0: some_initial_conditions,
          method: Dopri5()
      )
