    New methods ``'lanczos_diag'`` and the JAX version ``'jax_lanczos_diag'`` have been
    added to `solve_lmde`. This is an approximate matrix-exponentiation method, based 
    on diagonalizing an approximate projection of the generator to a small subspace (the Krylov Subspace),
    obtained via the Lanczos algorithm.  The size of this subspace is determined by the parameter ``k_dim``, 
    which controls the accuracy of the approximation. The method is recommended for sparse systems with 
    large dimension.
