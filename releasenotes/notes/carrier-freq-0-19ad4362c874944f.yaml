    In the case that ``envelope`` is a constant, the :meth:`Signal.__init__` method has been updated
    to not attempt to evaluate ``carrier_freq == 0.0`` if ``carrier_freq`` is a JAX tracer. In this
    case, it is not possible to determine if the :class:`Signal` instance is constant. This resolves
    an error that was being raised during JAX tracing if ``carrier_freq`` is abstract.
