    The internal attribute `DiscreteSignal._samples` has been removed,
    all methods should now be calling the public method `DiscreteSignal.samples`.

other:
  - |
    The behavior of the `DiscreteSignal` class has been changed, specifically the
    `envelope` function. The envelope will now return `0.0` if called on a time
    outside the defined range for the `DiscreteSignal`. This is achieved by padding 
    the samples, thus depreciating `DiscreteSignal._samples` in favor of `DiscreteSignal.samples`.
    Internally, the `envelope` function uses the internal attribute `DiscreteSignal._padded_samples`.
