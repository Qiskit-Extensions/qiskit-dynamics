features:
  - |
    This :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch` module has been rewritten to provide
    a common API for working directly with array types from different array
    libraries such as Numpy and JAX.
    
    This module allows registering other array backend libraries and custom
    function dispatch rules. Currently only Numpy and JAX are automatically
    registered.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch` module has been rewritten to allow
    direct usage for dispatching on library array types.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.default_backend` function has been
    deprecated. It has been superseeded by the
    :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.default_backend` class method for
    :class:~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array` objects, and the
    :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.default_library` function for the
    dispatch module.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.set_default_backend` function has been
    deprecated. It has been superseeded by the
    :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.set_default_backend` class method for
    :class:~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array` objects, and the
    :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.set_default_library` function for the
    dispatch module.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.backend_types` function has been
    deprecated. It has been superseeded by the
    :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.registered_types` function.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.available_backends` function has been
    deprecated. It has been superseeded by the
    :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.registered_libraries` function.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.required_backend` decorator function
    has been deprecated. It has been superseeded by the
    :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.required_library` function.
