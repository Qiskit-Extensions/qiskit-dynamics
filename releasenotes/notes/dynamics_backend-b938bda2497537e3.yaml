    Adds new class :class:`.DynamicsBackend`, which provides a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.backend.BackendV2` interface for running simulations with Qiskit
    Dynamics. This class can either be instantiated with a :class:`.Solver` instance configured for
    Pulse simulation, or through the :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.from_backend`, which builds an instance
    using the Hamiltonian description provided in an IBM backend.
