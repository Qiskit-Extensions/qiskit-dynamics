    :class:`.InstructionToSignals` has been updated to fix issues with phase accumulation
    resulting from ``SetFrequency`` and ``ShiftFrequency`` instructions. A phase accumulation
    term has been added so that the digitized carrier frequency is continuous across these 
    instructions. A related phase error when generating samples for channels subject to
    ``SetFrequency`` and ``ShiftFrequency`` instructions has also been fixed.
