    The logic of :class:`.InstructionToSignals` has been updated. 
    This change allows you to jit compile a function including 
    the converter with input pulse schedule that contains :class:`.SymbolicPulse`.

    .. code-block:: python

      from functools import partial
      import jax
      from qiskit import pulse
      from qiskit_dynamics.pulse import InstructionToSignals

      @partial(jax.jit, static_argnums=(0, 1))
      def run_simulation(amp, sigma):
          converter = InstructionToSignals(dt=1, carriers=None)
          with pulse.build() as schedule:
              pulse.play(pulse.Gaussian(160, amp, sigma), pulse.DriveChannel(0))
          signals = converter.get_signals(schedule)

          # continue with simulations
