    Adds JAX sparse evaluation mode to models and
    :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_classes.Solver`.
    This mode can be enabled by setting the ``evaluation_mode`` to
    ``'sparse'`` while ``dispatch.default_backend() == 'jax'``.
    This evaluation mode is only recommended for use on CPU unless
    the arrays are extremely sparse.
