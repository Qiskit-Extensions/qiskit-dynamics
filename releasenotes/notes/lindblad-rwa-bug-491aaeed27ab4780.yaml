    The ``rotating_wave_approximation`` function has been fixed in the case of
    the ``model`` argument being a ``LindbladModel`` with ``return_signal_map=True``.
    The returned signal mapping function was erroneously defined to take two inputs,
    one for Hamiltonian signals and one for dissipator signals. This behaviour has been updated
    to be consistent with the documentation, which states that in general this function accepts
    only a single argument (in this case a tuple storing both sets of signals).
