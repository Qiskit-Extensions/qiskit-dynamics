    This release fixes a bug in the initialisation of a DynamicsBackend when a Target object was provided for the initialisation.
    Furthermore, it also features the possibility to automatically load a control_channel_map from an existing backend when using 
    DynamicsBackend.from_backend() method. 
features:
  - |
    Initialising a DynamicsBackend instance using the from_backend() method now loads automatically the
    control_channel_map of the original backend to the DynamicsBackend option "control_channel_map".
    Note that if the user sets manually the option "control_channel_map", the provided option will overwrite 
    The default map from the original backend. 

fixes:
  - |
    A bug regarding the setting of the measurement properties at the initialisation of the
    DynamicsBackend instance was always resetting the measurement instruction to a default setting 
    even though there was already a measurement instruction stored in the provided Target object. This bug is now fixed
    and the measurement instruction is added only if the designated qubit in the provided Target does not have a measurement instruction.
