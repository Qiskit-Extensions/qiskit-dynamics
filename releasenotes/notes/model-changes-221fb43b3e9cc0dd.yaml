  - |
    The interface for :class:`.GeneratorModel`, :class:`.HamiltonianModel`, and
    :class:`.LindbladModel` has been modified. The ``copy`` method has been removed, and all setter
    methods other than ``in_frame_basis`` and ``signals`` have been removed. The ``evaluation_mode``
    construction argument has been replaced by ``array_library``, which controls which array library
    is used internally to store and evaluate operations, and the additional ``vectorized`` boolean
    argument has been added to :class:`.LindbladModel` to control whether the equation is evaluated
    in vectorized mode. Note that, regardless of array library used, dense arrays must be supplied
    to the constructors of these classes, due to peculiarities of the internal setup for sparse
    libraries.
