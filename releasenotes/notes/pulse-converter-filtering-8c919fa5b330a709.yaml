upgrade:
  - |
    The ``InstructionsToSignals`` converter has been updated to allow channel
    filtering. The converter now accepts an optional argument named ``channels``.
    It makes the converter return only those channels, specified by name such
    as "d0", in the same order in which they are given. Furthermore, the
    ``carriers`` argument is updated to a dictionary to make the mapping from
    channel names to carrier frequencies more obvious.
deprecations:
  - |
    Passing the ``carriers`` argument to ``InstructionToSignals`` as a ``list``
    has been deprecated and will be removed next release. The ``carriers`` argument
    should now be passed as a dictionary with channel names as keys and carrier
    frequencies as values.
