upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`~.Solver` API has been updated so that ``signals`` are passed
    as a kwarg to the :meth:`.Solver.solve` method rather than being set as a
    class attribute. A new instantiation argument, ``rwa_carrier_freqs``, has been
    added to control behaviour of the rotating wave approximation in the absence
    of signals being specified.
features:
  - |
    The  :meth:`.Solver.solve` method can now run multiple simulations in a single call by
    specifying one or more of the ``t_span``, ``y0``, and ``signals``
    arguments as lists of valid single inputs. This supports specifying all as a list of the
    same length (with a different value for each to be used in each simulation), or a subset
    can be specified with lists of the same length, with the other arguments giving only a single
    value (to be used repeatedly while varying the other parameters). Results are returned as a
    list of the results of the individual simulations. The list of simulations is performed
    in a serial loop.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``signals`` property and ``hamiltonian_signals`` and ``dissipator_signals`` init kwargs
    of :class:`.Solver` have been deprecated. Signals are now specified as a kwarg to the
    :meth:`.Solver.solve` method. The deprecated functionality is scheduled to be removed in the
    0.4.0 release.
  - |
    The :meth:`~.Solver.copy` method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed
    in the 0.4.0 release.
