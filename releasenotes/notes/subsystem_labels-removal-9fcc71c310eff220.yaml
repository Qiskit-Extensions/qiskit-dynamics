    The ``subsystem_labels`` option has been removed from the :class:`.DynamicsBackend`. This
    removal impacts some technical aspects of the backend returned by
    :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.from_backend` when the ``subsystem_list`` argument is used. Using the
    ``subsystem_list`` argument with :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.from_backend` restricts the internally
    constructed model to the qubits in ``subsystem_list``. When doing so previously, the option
    ``subsystem_labels`` would be set to ``subsystem_labels``, and ``subsystem_dims`` would record
    only the dimensions for the systems in ``subsystem_labels``. To account for the fact that
    ``subsystem_labels`` no longer exists, :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.from_backend` now constructs
    ``subsystem_dims`` to list a dimension for all of the qubits in the original backend, however
    now the dimensions of the removed systems are given as 1 (i.e. they are treated as trivial
    quantum systems with a single state). This change is made only for technical bookkeping
    purposes, and has no impact on the core simulation behaviour.
